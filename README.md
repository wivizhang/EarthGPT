##  :sparkles: Introduction
EarthGPT is a pioneering model designed to seamlessly unify multi-sensor and diverse remote sensing intelligent visual interpretation tasks in a unified framework, guided by user language instructions. EarthGPT is versatile at performing visual-language dialogues across optical, SAR, and infrared images. EarthGPT's capabilities extend to a wide range of tasks including scene classification, image description, visual question answering, target description, visual localization, and object detection.

##  :sparkles: MMRS-1M: Multi-modal Multi-sensor Remote Sensing Instruction Dataset

<u>___The entire data of MMRS-1M is released! 🚀___</u>

MMRS-1M is the largest multi-modal multi-sensor RS instruction-following dataset, consisting of over 1M image-text pairs that include optical, SAR, and infrared RS images. 

We release over 1M image-text pairs in the following link.
